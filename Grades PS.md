## Grades PS:

PS1: 8.25/10. Great job.

PS2: 7.5/10. Great job! See my solutions, you had some comments and potentially some graphs/computations incorrect. For example, the monetary variables were in US dollars not Ugandan Shillings!! and the exchange rate is around 1$ - 3000 USh

PS3: 7.25, excellent. You missed some computations and comments in ex1 and ex2.

PS4: 7.5/10, excellent. Check exercise 1. At optimization problems you need to provide the solution, the vector x*. Also note that Nelder-Mead does not converge so it is actually the algorithm doing worse for this particular exercise (and given the x0).
